# Unit 1: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This unit covers fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through practical Python implementations.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Basic Class Hierarchy
- Demonstrates inheritance with Vehicle and Car classes
- Shows proper use of `super()` for parent class initialization
- File: `Task1-Basic-Class-Hierarchy.py`

### Task 2: Polymorphism with Methods
- Implements abstract Shape class with Circle and Rectangle subclasses
- Uses area calculation as polymorphic method
- Demonstrates use of ABC and abstractmethod
- File: `Task2-Polymorphism-with-Methods.py`

### Task 3: Encapsulation with Access Control
- Implements BankAccount class with private balance
- Shows proper encapsulation with getter/setter methods
- Includes validation for deposits and withdrawals
- File: `Task3-Encapsulation with Access Control.py`

### Task 4: Abstraction with Base Class
- Creates abstract Animal class with concrete subclasses
- Demonstrates method overriding
- Shows proper use of abstract base classes
- File: `Task4-Abstraction-with-Base-Class.py`

### Task 5: Constructor and Destructor
- Implements Person class with constructor and destructor
- Shows object lifecycle management
- Demonstrates proper cleanup with `__del__`
- File: `Task5-Constructor-and-Destructor.py`

## Running the Code

Each task can be run independently using Python 3:

```bash
python Task1-Basic-Class-Hierarchy.py
python Task2-Polymorphism-with-Methods.py
python "Task3-Encapsulation with Access Control.py"
python Task4-Abstraction-with-Base-Class.py
python Task5-Constructor-and-Destructor.py
```

## Key OOP Concepts Covered

1. **Inheritance**
   - Base and derived classes
   - Method inheritance
   - Constructor chaining

2. **Polymorphism**
   - Method overriding
   - Abstract methods
   - Interface-like behavior

3. **Encapsulation**
   - Private attributes
   - Public interfaces
   - Data validation

4. **Abstraction**
   - Abstract base classes
   - Method contracts
   - Implementation hiding

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ABC module (built-in)
- math module (built-in)
